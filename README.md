# MedEase
MedEase is a application that can detect and identify medicines based on the appearance of the packaging, also can help people to manage their daily medicine. The problem we are addressing is defines self-medication as treatment without seeking medical advice in Indonesia. In Indonesia, a staggering 84.34% of the population resort to self-medicating, as revealed by a 2022 BPS survey. While factors like advertising, past treatment experiences, economic constraints, and patient education play a role in this practice, it's not without its perils. Self-medication carries the potential for serious health complications and adverse reactions due to misuse of medications.
